<h2> Week 5 (Vampire Survivor Analysis)<h2>

<p>
Vampire Survivor is a 2022 roguelite video game that took the world by storm because of it's simplycity and addictive gameplay.
It combines many existing and established ideas in a way that felt new and refreshing at the time it came out.

When you first play the game, nothing needs to be explained to the player. You move the character by using the arrow keys and 
you realize that the character attacks periodically. All you need to do is move and position yourself to make your attacks hit the enemies.
  
The enemies come from every border of the screen and walk towards you. You need to evade them while positioning yourself to attack them.
This simple gameplay combines elements of casual games because of the low number of inputs with elements of challenging roguelite games
where precision is important and the stakes feel high. 

We could argue that the game failed to keep me entertained for an extended amount of time, but I still played it for nearly 10 hours.
For what it's worth, this game did it's job for it's very small price of 5$. I would love to create games that are also limited to a
very small amounf of inputs (in this case 4), but that also provide depth in the gameplay (in this case the precision of the movements).
