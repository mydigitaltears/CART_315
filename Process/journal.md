<h2> Week 5 (Vampire Survivor Analysis)<h2>

<p>
Vampire Survivor is a 2022 roguelite video game that took the world by storm because of it's simplycity and addictive gameplay.
It combines many existing and established ideas in a way that felt new and refreshing at the time it came out.

When you first play the game, nothing needs to be explained to the player. You move the character by using the arrow keys and 
you realize that the character attacks periodically. All you need to do is move and position yourself to make your attacks hit the enemies.
  
The enemies come from every border of the screen and walk towards you. You need to evade them while positioning yourself to attack them.
This simple gameplay combines elements of casual games because of the low number of inputs with elements of challenging roguelite games
where precision is important and the stakes feel high. Every time you kill and enemy, they drop some experience gem on where they die. 

If you grab enough of them you will level up, and are presented between 3 choices of either new weapons or upgrades for you current weapons.
This style of build choice is very present in modern roguelite games because they combine randomness with decision making in a way that
makes every run feel different than the one before. It adds a lot of depth and replay value to a game because the player is "forced" to
try different ways of playing. The gameplay loop of killing enemies, gaining experience and upgrading your character is as classic as it
gets when it comes to video games, but Vampire Survivor does it well and it does it fast. After a few minutes you start having a lot of
attacks, the damage numbers go up and you start to feel the crazyness of the game. 

The goal of the game is to survive for 30 minutes and
as the time passes the ennemies come in greater number, deal more damage and have more health. It is not easy to win a run at first, but
as you play the game you realise which weapons work well together and how you can build your character properly to become overpowered and
nearly untouchable.
