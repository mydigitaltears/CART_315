<h2> Week 5 (Vampire Survivor Analysis)<h2>

<p>
Vampire Survivor is a 2022 roguelite video game that took the world by storm because of it's simplicity and addictive gameplay.
It combines many existing and established ideas in a way that felt new and refreshing at the time it came out.

When you first play the game, nothing needs to be explained to the player. You move the character by using the arrow keys and
you realize that the character attacks periodically. All you need to do is move and position yourself to make your attacks hit the enemies.

The enemies come from every border of the screen and walk towards you. You need to evade them while positioning yourself to attack them.
This simple gameplay combines elements of casual games because of the low number of inputs with elements of challenging roguelite games
where precision is important and the stakes feel high.

We could argue that the game failed to keep me entertained for an extended amount of time, but I still played it for nearly 10 hours.
For what it's worth, this game did it's job for it's very small price of 5$. I would love to create games that are also limited to a
very small amounf of inputs (in this case 4), but that also provide depth in the gameplay (in this case the precision of the movements).

<h2> Week 7 (Conceptualizing prototypes)<h2>

<p>
I wanted to explore the notion of impossible games, or games that you have to push the boundaries of what the game allows you to do in order to win it. Games that are mechanically hard or that could encourage thinking outside of the box to beat them!

The first idea I had was a rhythm game in a factory setting with conveyor belts. The player operates different machines with different keys and as the game goes the player has to keep track of more and more timings.

Another idea I had was a multiple answer conversation game based in a fictional language. With every answer you give you can see the reaction of the other character, this way can understand what the words mean to some extent. The kind of storytelling of a fictional world in this reminds me of what has been done with the game: Papers, Please!

I also thought of exploring games using the microphone, where the player would give instructions to a secret agent or general directions over the phone to complete some kind of objective.


I then decided to prototype my first idea using three different rhythms of blocks falling down. After some playtesting I was able to get the hand of the timings so it was not to hard, but the goal would be to extend this concept into as many different keys as possible. After seeing other people playtest it, it seemed very hard to keep track of the timings, which can be a good or bad thing. The game seemed also quite alienating. It could actually be something to explore further given the plan of making it in a factory setting. Altough I was telling people that nothing new was going to come after the 3rd kind of timing starts appearing, people kept playing it for a while just zoning out trying to hit the blocks.
